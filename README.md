# pygame-tutorial
Originally started working from RealPython's PyGame Tutorial(https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) to expand my knowledge, and work on a fun side project. When I ran into issues even getting the demo code from that tutorial to run, as did many people in the comments, I switched to an opensource tuturial here(https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-moving-player)
